# Final Project for CSE125/Logic Design with SystemVerilog
The goal of this project is to design and implement an FPGA based game similar to that of the sound/memory game SIMON.
The details of this project will be added at a later date.

PHILLIP, please only checkout and commit changes to a branch that you make. Piano branch is for me to make experimental changes to the sound synthesizer that I have already created.
